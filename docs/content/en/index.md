Now it's easy to create tests for projects and modules using Nuxt.

## Key features

## Why `@nuxt/test-utils`?

This library allows you to test your Nuxt app or module. It includes unit and end-to-end test helpers, but is not intended as a substitute for component test libraries like `@vue/test-utils`.

With this library you can interact with a Nuxt instance - whether that is verifying a plugin or module is behaving as expected, getting a fully-rendered server response or conducting client-side browser tests using playwright.
